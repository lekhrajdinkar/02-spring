# A. Choosing Right database
- `Data model`
  - RDBMS / NoSQL
  - Joins? Structured? Semi-Structured?
  - Strong schema? More flexibility?
  - Reporting? Search?
    
- `performance` : 
  - Throughput, 
  - Read-heavy, write-heavy, balanced workload
  - Latency requirements
  - Concurrent users?
  
- `Size` :
  - How much data to store and for how long? 
  - Will it grow? 
  - Average object size?
  
- `availability (global DB), replicate, DR Support, backup/recovery`
- `Security`
- `cost`

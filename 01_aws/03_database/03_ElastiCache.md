# ElastiCache
- if data changing slowly, then have it. eg:
  - `key-value` caching
  - `aggregations-results` caching
  - ...
- AWS offering :  
  - `Redis`,
  - `MemCache`
  - `MemoryDB` has Redis like api.
- **advantages**:
  - sub ms latency.
- **negative side**
  - need application code changes.
  - Data may be out of date, eventually consistent.
  - not suited for un-structured  data.

## A cache use-cases
### **Database Read**
  - prg <--- DB (state)
  - prg (`code` changes to use cache ) <--- `Cache` <--- DB(Data) : for stateless Application
    - `low latency`
    - `high performance`
    - `reduce load` off of databases for read intensive workloads
    - ![img.png](../99_img/redis/img.png)
    - lazy loading(stale read) and write-through(sync cache with DB)
### **Maintain user Session**

## B Type
###  1 `Redis` 
- think of RDS, similar :point_left:
- internal: 
  - uses `Sets`(uniqness) and `SortedSets` (uniqueness + ordering)
  - `cluster` > `shard`(node group) > `node`(cache)
  - One primary Node (choose: ec2 intance type)
  - select upto **5 Read Replicas** to scale reads and have high availability
  - enable/disable: `Multi AZ` with Auto-Failover, more cost.
    - Read replica-1 --> az-1
    - Read replica-2 --> az-2, etc

#### Redis::Demo
```
- Create REDIS (.rdb file)
- Choose : Design youe own cache
    - method : Easy, cluster cache ** , restore(from .rdb)
    - cluster name, password, port
    - maintenece window
    - security : encryption (rest /fly)
    - enable logs
    - tags
    - VPC/subnet
    - redis Engine : vesrion, ec2 instance type, count of Read replica
    
    === READY ===
    
    - primary end point
    - reader end point
    - backup/restore
```

### 2 `MemCache`
- No high availability (replication)
- `Non persistent` 
- No backup/restore
- Security: `SASL` (more advance)
- Multi-threaded architecture ?
- Multi-node for partitioning of data (sharding) ?

### 3 `Memory DB for redis` : intro
![img_4.png](../99_img/dva/00/img_4.png)
- Ultra-fast performance with over `160 millions requests/second` :point_left:
- **Durable in-memory data storage** 
  - with Multi-AZ, hundreds of nodes
  - Scale seamlessly from `10s GBs` >>> `100s TBs` of storage
- **Use cases**: 
  - web and mobile apps, 
  - online gaming, 
  - media streaming,
  - …

## C strategies ( **caching design pattern** )
### 1. **Lazy Loading** or Population / Cache-Aside
![img.png](../99_img/dva/00/imgg.png)
- flow for understanding:
  - **hit-1**: read from cache : found ok
  - not found, **hit-2**: read from db
  - **hit-3**: set cache
  - next:
    - `case:1`  Data update on some other api
      - cache will become stale / inconsistent.
      - this is drawback. 
      - **write-through strategy** solves it. next
    - `case:2 ` new data-1 wrote on DB, by some other api
      - read data-1 from cache will miss
      - since cache was updated after write.
      - **write-through strategy** solves it. next
      
- sample psuedo code for understanding:
  - ![img_1.png](../99_img/dva/00/img_1.png)

### 2. **write-through**
![img_2.png](../99_img/dva/00/img_2.png)
- each write on DB, requires 2 hit:
  - hit-1: write on DB
  - hit-2: write on cache
  - pseudo code:
  - ![img_3.png](../99_img/dva/00/img_3.png)
- drawback:
  - **cache churn**: writing lot n lot of data in cache, which will be never read.
  - **cache-eviction and TTL** resolves it. next

### 3. **cache-eviction**
- set eviction policy by
  - **LRU** (least recently used)
  - **TTL** (sec, min, hr, days)
